# Disney Jokes MCP Server Implementation

## Requirements
- Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Python
- The server should return jokes related to Disney animation movies
- This is for demo purposes only, no tests are required

## Additional comments from user
- User requested to follow Python project best practices as defined in `/home/weinongw/repos/mcp-simple/.github/.copilot/specifications/python-project-specifications/python-project.md`
- This includes using `uv` as the package manager, using `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`, and ensuring virtual environment directories are in `.gitignore`

## Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
- **Task 1.1**: Initialize Python project using `uv init`
- **Task 1.2**: Set up virtual environment using `uv`
- **Task 1.3**: Add MCP Python SDK dependency using `uv add`
- **Task 1.4**: Update `.gitignore` to exclude virtual environment directory

### Phase 2: Implement Core MCP Server Functionality
- **Task 2.1**: Create basic MCP server using FastMCP
- **Task 2.2**: Create Disney jokes data store
- **Task 2.3**: Implement joke retrieval functionality

### Phase 3: Implement MCP Protocol Support
- **Task 3.1**: Set up proper MCP protocol initialization
- **Task 3.2**: Configure model information and capabilities
- **Task 3.3**: Implement Disney joke generation tool

### Phase 4: Run and Manual Test
- **Task 4.1**: Run the MCP server locally
- **Task 4.2**: Test the endpoints using curl or a REST client

## Success Criteria
- The MCP server starts successfully
- The server responds to health check and model info requests
- The server returns Disney-themed jokes when prompted via the completion endpoint
- The server follows the MCP protocol specification

## Decisions
1. We will use the Python MCP SDK which provides a simple interface for creating MCP servers.
2. We'll leverage the FastMCP class which allows us to define tools and resources using Python decorators.
3. The server will expose a tool to generate Disney-themed jokes.
4. The server will run on stdio transport for easy testing and integration with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.
5. We'll create a database of Disney animation movie-related jokes to return to users.
6. We will follow Python project best practices as specified in `/home/weinongw/repos/mcp-simple/.github/.copilot/specifications/python-project-specifications/python-project.md`:
   - Use `uv` as the package manager
   - Use `pyproject.toml` for dependency management instead of `requirements.txt`
   - Ensure virtual environment directories are included in `.gitignore`

## Implementation Details
The implementation will follow this structure:

1. **Project Structure**
   ```
   mcp-simple/
   ├── disney_jokes.py  # Main server file
   ├── pyproject.toml  # Project configuration and dependencies
   └── README.md        # Documentation
   ```

2. **Server Implementation**
   The server will be built using the FastMCP class from the MCP Python SDK. It will:
   - Define a collection of Disney-themed jokes in a Python data structure
   - Implement a tool to retrieve jokes based on:
     - Character name (e.g., Mickey, Elsa, Simba)
     - Movie name (e.g., Frozen, Lion King)
     - Theme (e.g., princesses, animals)
     - Random (when no specific parameters are provided)
   - Include proper error handling and user-friendly responses
   - Support both specific joke requests and random joke selection

3. **MCP Protocol Support (Phase 3 Details)**
   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) requires specific implementation aspects:
   
   - **Protocol Initialization**: The MCP server needs to properly initialize and advertise its capabilities. We'll configure the FastMCP class with appropriate server name and description, focusing on Disney joke generation.
   
   - **Model Information**: We'll configure the model information to represent our joke service, including:
     - Name: "Disney-Jokes-Generator"
     - Version: "1.0"
     - Description: "A joke generation service focused on Disney animation characters and movies"
   
   - **Tools Implementation**: Rather than traditional REST endpoints, MCP uses "tools" that can be invoked:
     - `get_joke`: Main tool that returns Disney-themed jokes based on input parameters
     - Tool parameters will include character, movie, theme, and format options
   
   - **Simple Implementation**: We'll keep the implementation focused solely on the joke generation tool without additional resource endpoints.
   
   The MCP approach allows LLMs like Claude to understand our service's capabilities and invoke our tools directly through natural language conversations.

4. **Running the Server**
   The server will be configured to run on the stdio transport, making it compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
1. Initialized Python project using `uv init`, which created:
   - pyproject.toml
   - .python-version
   - main.py 
   - README.md
2. Set up virtual environment using `uv venv`, creating `.venv` directory
3. Added MCP Python SDK dependency using `uv add "mcp[cli]"`
4. Created `.gitignore` file to exclude virtual environment directory and other common Python artifacts

### Phase 2: Implement Core MCP Server Functionality
1. Renamed main.py to disney_jokes.py
2. Implemented the basic MCP server using FastMCP class
3. Created a Disney jokes database with jokes categorized by characters and movies
4. Implemented joke retrieval functionality with character and movie filtering
5. Added error handling and fallback to general jokes
6. Created a comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions

### Phase 3: Implement MCP Protocol Support
1. Enhanced MCP server initialization with detailed configuration
2. Added server name, description, and version information
3. Configured initialization options with context data
4. Enhanced tool documentation and descriptions
5. Added informative console output on server startup
